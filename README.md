# Direct-Digital-Synthesis
Generation of Sine wave using DDS


Direct digital synthesis (DDS) is a method of producing an analog waveform—usually a sine wave—by generating a time-varying signal in digital form and then performing a digital-to-analog conversion. Since it  has High frequency resolution.since it has high frequency resolution, frequency conversion speed and phase can changecontinuously, in radar, communication, electronic instrument, and other fields have a wide range of applications.As a programmable digital integrated circuit2, FPGA has advantages such as short development cycle, high reliability.

The direct digital frequency synthesizer (DDS) includes phase accumulator (PA), phase converter (Amplitude/Sine converter Algorithm), digital analog converter (DAC). It’s traditional structure as shown in the below figure, N a phase accumulator is composed of adder and register, frequency control word N control step for each of the adder, when its and greater than overflow, to complete a cycle
