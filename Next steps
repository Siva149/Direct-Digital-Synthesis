Next work in progress & Ideas to Implement it: 
            1. LED Blink on the Board on every rotation(or Frequency count)
                    i. Assigning the Increment value to the LED Constraints in XDC file.
            
            2. Creating the QPSK & O-QPSK Signal from the obtained Sine wave.
                    i. Its a quite challenging one. For example; given the 8 bit i/p data, its been splitted to ODD and EVEN bits using Splitter(Serial to parallel converter)
                    ii. Even bits are considered as Inphase and ODD bits are considered as Quadrature Phase. With the 90 deg phase shift mulipled with the obtained Sine wave (Local osc), 
                        We can create the decent QPSK/O-Qpsk Signal 
                    
            3. Displaying the obtained signals on the monitor using VGA Connector and cable
                     i. Instantiating  VGA Controller with Specifications like refresh rate/DPI, Assign the signals to the VGA Contraints in the XDC File 
                    
 Hopefully its interesting :)
